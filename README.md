Have weekly or even daily meetings? Do you ever feel annoyed with clicking the same like every single time to join the meeting? Well you don't anymore! 
JoinMeetings is a program that uses a GUI interface that will let you enter in the day, time, and link for your meeting. After that, you can sit back, relax, and the program will do the rest. No more clicking links to join the same meetings. It will all be done for you.
