# JoinMeetings

## About
While we are at home, we must take all our meetings from home. This
means that there are many meetings you have to join online per day.
In person, we would just walk to the classroom or confrence room, 
but online we are clicking links over and over again. This program 
automates that process for you. You enter in the time, day, and link 
for your meeting (or any link you want to open), and the program will 
open that link at the time given **all the time**. 

## Installation
On the right, a realeases tab shows. Download the 
**__JoinMeetings.zip__** file and unzip it. 

#### For Mac/Linux:
Double click on the executable file or go to the directory and 
run `./JoinMeetings` in the terminal

#### For Windows: 
Click on the JoinMeetings.exe file.
